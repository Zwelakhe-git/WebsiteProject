                    <p class="news-excerpt">The 2025 Russia–United States Summit (also known as the Alaska 2025 or the Trump–Putin Summit) was a summit meeting between United States president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. It was held on August 15, 2025, at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>The main topic of discussion was the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. The summit ended without an agreement being announced, although Trump later intimated that in his view the onus was now on Ukraine to cede territory in order to end the war.</p>

                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>A team of researchers at Quantum Labs International has announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing stability. Their new error-correction technique has demonstrated the ability to maintain quantum coherence for unprecedented durations, addressing one of the fundamental challenges in practical quantum computing.</p>
                        <p>"This represents a quantum leap forward, quite literally," said Dr. Elena Rodriguez, lead researcher on the project. "We've effectively extended the window for reliable quantum operations by several orders of magnitude."</p>
                        <p>The breakthrough could accelerate the development of practical quantum computers capable of solving complex problems in fields ranging from drug discovery to climate modeling. The team has published their findings in the latest issue of Nature Physics.</p>

                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>Researchers at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute have developed a new neural network model called CreativeNet that demonstrates remarkable abilities in artistic creation. The model can generate original paintings, compose music, and even write poetry that is indistinguishable from human-created works in blind tests.</p>
                        <p>"What sets CreativeNet apart is its ability to understand and work within aesthetic principles rather than just mimicking patterns," explained lead researcher Dr. James Wilson. "It's not just replicating—it's creating with intentionality."</p>
                        <p>The model has raised interesting questions about the nature of creativity and the potential for AI to collaborate with human artists. The research team is exploring applications in design, entertainment, and therapy.</p>
